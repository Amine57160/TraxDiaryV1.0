 ReST directive for embedding Youtube and Vimeo videos.
    There are two directives added: ``youtube`` and ``vimeo``. The only
    argument is the video id of the video to include.
    Both directives have three optional arguments: ``height``, ``width``
    and ``align``. Default height is 281 and default width is 500.
    Example::
        .. youtube:: anwy2MPT5RE
            :height: 315
            :width: 560
            :align: left
